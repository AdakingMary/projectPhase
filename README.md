Title
To-Do List App

Description
The purpose of this application is to help users achieve their goals at the end of each day by managing their tasks properly. This app will help users prevent procrastination and inconsistency as it aims to make every day count. With its unique features like ticking a task good if it is achieved within a set period of time which the user has the flexibility to provider It will also notify users when a particular task is near its end of completion. If the user is able to finish a task at the right time, he/she will click on the task and it will be marked "good". It is my hope that with this application, users will become more consistent and proficient at work and in their personal lives. Thank you.
